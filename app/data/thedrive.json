Then, the app check some point of interest (stored in a json) in a rectangle area (around 50km each side) around all legs of the route. After that, it redraw a route with the chosen POI as waypoints. It then pull photos from Panoramio API in the area of each waypoint.</p><h3>Animations</h3><p>All animations are rendered in a single requestAnimationFrame moving all parts only when they appear on the screen. The car following the user simply follow a path generated by a SVG (directly exported from Illustrator) representing the line in the images. </p><h2>Check it out</h2><p><a href='http://contents.vw.ca/vw4/the_drive/index.php?lang=en' target='_blank'>The Drive</a></p>"
